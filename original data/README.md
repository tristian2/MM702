## Synopsis

Report and files for an exercise in data analysis


## Motivation

It is good practice to place artefacts under version control.  Even though this exercise isn't code, we will see benefits in placing the files under version control, for say rolling back any mistakes or changes.

This is an exercise in using data analytics techniques to make conclusions on two sets of data from
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
and
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult

## Installation

Copy the files locally and use SPSS modeller to work with the streams

## Tests

We may look into using simple unit-tests to analyse the data for any bad values
